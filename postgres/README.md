# Postgres Tutorial [[view code]](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/marcotav/data-engineering-tutorials/blob/master/postgres/postgreSQL-tutorial_1.ipynb) 

This tutorial is based on [this blog article about the same topic](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/loading-data-into-postgres/).

Data storage a crucial part of any data system. It is important to understand how your data can be stored and accessed. **Data engineers** build architectures for data platforms enabling data scientists to query their data. They are responsible for building data pipelines that connect the pieces of the data ecosystem. They are familiar with:
- Working with large datasets
- Automation of intensive queries
- The architecture of robust data platforms

Each part of the pipeline below is built/maintained by a data engineer.

In this notebook I will describe one example **relational databases**, [`PostgreSQL`](https://www.postgresql.org/) more specifically. `PostgreSQL` is one of the main open source relational databases.
